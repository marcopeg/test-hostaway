# Plan Task

Use `backlog-plan` to create or revise a milestone plan for a refined task.

## Storage Model

- Backlog root: `docs/backlog`
- Canonical task file: `<taskid>.task.md`
- Plan file: `<taskid>.plan.md`
- Plan files are content-only artifacts and must not own frontmatter.
- All task-level frontmatter belongs only in `<taskid>.task.md`.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the task from active status folders.
2. Read `<taskid>.task.md` first.
3. Read question, clarify, notes, and existing plan artifacts when useful.
4. Apply the review gate before planning.
5. Create or update `<taskid>.plan.md`.
6. Rebuild root and status-local backlog indexes.
7. Ask exactly: `Do you accept the plan?`

## Review Gate

Treat the task as reviewed when the canonical task file has planning-ready content for:

- `Business Gain`
- `Current State`
- `Desired State`
- `Definition of Success`
- `Constraints`
- `Acceptance Criteria`

If the task does not appear reviewed, ask exactly:

`This task does not appear to have been reviewed yet. Do you want to review it first, or should I proceed with the planning anyway?`

## Plan Structure

Plan files use checkbox progress and no YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
# Plan — <Task title>

## Goal

<short outcome>

## Milestones

### Milestone 1 — <name>

- [ ] Step 1 — <short label>
  - Achieve:
  - Create:
  - Modify:
  - Delete:
  - Touch points:
  - Validation:
  - Notes:
```

## Acceptance Semantics

- `accept` only: transition the task to `planned`.
- `accept and execute`: transition to `planned`, then to `wip`, then continue with `backlog-execute`.
- Planning must not set `startedAt` or `completedAt`.
- The task folder must move into the status folder matching its current status.

Use the shared transition helper where practical:

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/backlog-core/scripts/backlog_tool.py transition <taskid> --to-state planned
```

Never modify `CHANGELOG.md`.
